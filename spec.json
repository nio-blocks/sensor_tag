SensorTags are read from, and the block notifies a signal, each time a signal is processed by SensorTagRead.  *keypress* can be turned on to read button presses from the SensorTag. Note that a SensorTag can not be configured to use *keypress* if other sensors are also being used. Any input signal into the block will break the block if *keypress* is enabled.",
